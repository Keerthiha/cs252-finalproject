Can't decide where to eat? Tired of arguing with your friends and family about picking a place? 
With our app, you can make a spontaneous decision by letting us offer you a random restaurant in your city! 
You can also save restaurants to lists to view later.                   
We used the Yelp API to make requests, Node.js for server side, Mongodb and Mongoose for database handling, HTML and CSS,  
and Passport.js for Authentication
